# A simple html page


##### This is a simple html page for study, exercising css, react and styled components. I plan to use sass in my css and interactivity as well. That said, I would like to say that any feedback is appreciated.

##### Next changes should be:

 - Using SASS;
 - Separate data in a JSON file;
 - Add any event just for the sake of using it.
